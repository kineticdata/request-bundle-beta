%WEBAPP_ROOT%/themes/%THEME_NAME%

== /config
This directory is intended to contain any applicable "configuration" files.
This may include a CSS file containing color classes (such as .primaryColor or
.secondaryColor), a Javascript file containing necessary variables, a JSP file
configuring variables used throughout the Theme, or any other appropriate
content.  This directory may be ignored if the theme is not intended to be
configurable outside of the modification of the theme files themselves.

== /css
This directory includes the CSS files that are used by the theme.  Typically,
this will include a "theme.css" file for the core CSS configuration used
throughout the site (such as default fonts, colors, and re-usable classes) and a
subdirectory for page specific CSS.

  === /css/pages
  This directory includes the CSS files that are used by specific JSP pages
  (such as the Portal page, Login page, or a Service Item page template).
  Typically this will include a css file named based on the page that it styles.
  For example, the CSS for the "portal.jsp" page would likely be "portal.css".

== /images
This directory includes any of the images that are generated specifically for
use with the theme.

== /js
This directory includes the Javascript files that are used by the theme.
Typically this will include a "theme.js" file for the core Javascript used
throughout the site and a subdirectory for page specific Javascript.

  === /js/pages
  This directory includes the Javascript files that are used by specific JSP
  pages (such as the Portal page, Login page, or a Service Item page template).
  Typically this will include Javascript files named by the page that it is
  associated to.  For example, the Javascript for the "portal.jsp" page would
  likely be portal.js.

== /jsp
This directory includes the bulk of the rendering logic for the site.  Typically
there will not be any files included directly in this folder, but there are
multiple subdirectories used to organize the theme.

  === /jsp/helpers
  This directory includes a series of JSP files that define Java classes
  intended to abstract complicated logic into methods that are simpler to use in
  the rendered JSP pages.

  === /jsp/includes
  This directory includes the files that initialize the environment.   At
  minimum, this will include a "themeInitialization.jsp", which prepares the
  variables used during the rendering of the requested JSP page, and a
  "themeLoader.jspf", which prepares the requested page JSP and loads the helper
  and model files.

    === /jsp/includes/application
    This directory includes two special JSP partials that are necessary for
    Kinetic Request to function properly.  The "headerContent.jsp" should be
    included in the HTML head element of all JSP pages that are used to render
    Kinetic Request forms.    This file includes the Javascript and CSS files
    used by the Kinetic Request application.  The "templateContent.jsp" should
    be included somewhere in the HTML body element of all JSP pages.  This file
    renders the actual Form question content that is defined in the Kinetic
    Request Catalog Console.

  === /jsp/models
  This directory includes the "base" definitions of Java class definitions
  intended to interact with serialized data.  For most sites, this directory
  will include a single Java class that defines the basic interaction with the
  BMC Remedy and a collection of directories that correspond to the Remedy
  applications that are interacted with.  Subdirectories in this folder include
  Java class definitions that specify the mapping of BMC Remedy forms and fields
  to simplified Java objects.

    === /jsp/models/kineticSample
    This directory includes a collection of model classes that correspond to
    KS_SAMPLE_* form records.

    === /jsp/models/kineticRequest
    This directory includes a collection of model classes that correspond to
    Kinetic Request records.

    === /jsp/models/kineticTask
    This directory includes a collection of model classes that correspond to
    Kinetic Task records.

  === /jsp/pages
  This directory includes the JSP pages that are rendered when a request is
  made.  The directory will typically include a "portal.jsp" that defines the
  Catalog Home page, a "login.jsp" that defines the primary Login page, a
  "display.jsp" file that defines the page that Service Items are rendered with,
  and any other JSP pages that are used by the bundle.  Additionally, this
  directory may contain subdirectories of content used in a specific PAGE.

    === /jsp/pages/PAGE
    These subdirectories are typically named the same as their associated JSP
    file (the "portal.jsp" file will typically have an associated "portal"
    directory in the /jsp/pages folder), and are used to logically break apart
    page sections or fragments.

      === /jsp/pages/PAGE/callbacks
      This subdirectory will not be included in every PAGE directory, but is
      used to signify that the contents render responses to AJAX requests.

  === /jsp/shared
  This directory includes various JSP page fragments or partials that are shared
  between multiple pages.  Examples include common header or footer images, HTML
  head content, or any other re-usable section of code.

== /resources
Directory used to store CSS, images, and javascript libraries that are not
customized as part of the theme.  This could include css templates (such as
company templates or the YUI reset CSS), image libraries, or javascript
libraries (such as YUI, jQuery, or others).
